<p><strong>2.1</strong>	This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Developer may publish Listings on GitHub Marketplace for purchase of Developer Products by End Users and use in connection with GitHub.com.  This Agreement is applicable to Developer’s Products distributed for free and Products for which End Users are charged a fee.  Developer agrees to use the GitHub Marketplace solely for purposes permitted by this Agreement or as otherwise allowed by applicable law.  As between GitHub and Developer, Developer is solely responsible for Developer Products.</p>

<p><strong>2.2</strong>	Developer grants to GitHub a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to (a) host, link to, reproduce, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, test, distribute, make available, license and otherwise use the Listing; (b) reproduce, perform, display, use and access the Listing for administration and demonstration purposes in connection with the operation and marketing of the Marketplace; and (c)  reproduce, display, distribute and otherwise use any Developer Brand Features furnished by Developer to GitHub under this Agreement solely for use in connection with the Marketplace and in order to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>2.3</strong>	In addition to the licenses granted above, GitHub may include Developer Brand Features furnished by Developer to GitHub under this Agreement in any presentations, communications, marketing materials, press releases, customer lists (including, without limitation any customer lists, posted to GitHub websites), publicity campaigns and other advertising collateral for purposes of marketing the Marketplace.  If Developer discontinues the distribution of specific Products on the Marketplace, GitHub will, after a commercially reasonable period of time, cease use of the discontinued Products’ Brand Features.  Nothing in this Agreement gives Developer a right to use any GitHub Brand Features.</p>

<p><strong>2.4</strong>	Developer grants to each End User a non-exclusive, worldwide right or license to perform, display, and use the Products and any content contained in, accessed by or transmitted through the Products in connection with the Marketplace.  Developer must include a separate end user license agreement (“EULA”) in its Products that will govern the End User’s rights to the Products in lieu of the foregoing sentence.  Developer acknowledges and agrees that the applicable EULA for each Product is solely between Developer and the End User.  GitHub shall not be responsible, nor have any liability whatsoever, under any EULA.</p>

<p><strong>2.5</strong>	Except for the license rights granted in this Agreement, (a) Developer retains all rights in the Products; (b) each party retains all rights it has independent of this Agreement, including rights under the US Copyright Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions; and (c) each party owns all rights, title and interest in its respective Brand Features.  Each party is responsible for protecting and enforcing its own respective rights and neither party has an obligation to do so on the other’s behalf.</p>

<p><strong>2.6</strong>	Developer acknowledges and agrees that GitHub shall be entitled to provide Developer’s name, address and other contact details to any third party that reasonably, in GitHub’s sole determination, claims that Developer does not possess all of the necessary intellectual property rights in or to the Products.</p>

<h3 id="3-restrictions-and-responsibilities">3.	RESTRICTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding any of the requirements set forth in Section 2, Purpose and License Grant, above, Developer acknowledges and agrees that its use of the Marketplace and participation in the Program is explicitly conditioned on Developer’s adherence to this Agreement, including without limitation, the restrictions and compliance requirements set forth in this Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>3.1</strong>	Developer agrees it will protect the privacy and legal rights of all End Users.  If an End User provides Developer with, or the Product otherwise collects, discloses, accesses or uses, End User names, passwords or other personal information, then the Developer must (a) inform End Users that such information will be available to the Products; and (b) provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection to End Users.  Further, Developer Products may only use the information for the limited purpose for which Developer has obtained permission from End User. If Developer Products store or transmit personal or sensitive information provided by or obtained from End Users, then Developer must ensure all such activity is done so securely and must respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from GitHub or Marketplace End Users</p>

<p><strong>3.2</strong>	In order to use and access the GitHub API, Developer must obtain API credentials (a “Token”) by becoming a subscriber. Developer may not share its Token with any third party, shall keep such Token and all login information secure and shall use the Token as Developer’s sole means of accessing the GitHub API.</p>

<p><strong>3.7.12</strong> Security Intelligence Sharing
GitHub may, at its discretion, choose to share security intelligence that may have an impact on GitHub customer and account security. Developer agrees to participate in such discussions to ensure the security of GitHub customer and user accounts and data.</p>

<p><strong>3.8</strong>	GitHub reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately if GitHub determines that Developer breached any requirement or obligation of this Section 3.</p>

<p><strong>3.9</strong> Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from developing and/or publishing applications that are similar or otherwise compete with the other party’s applications.</p>

<h3 id="4-takedowns">4.	TAKEDOWNS</h3>

<p><strong>4.1</strong>	Your Takedowns. Upon providing GitHub with thirty (30) days written notice in advance of the 1st day of the succeeding calendar month, you may remove your Listings from future distribution via Marketplace, but you must comply with this Agreement for any Listing distributed through Marketplace, including but not limited to refund requirements. Removing your Listing from future distribution via Marketplace does not (a) affect the license rights of End Users who have previously purchased or installed your Listing or (b) change your obligation to deliver or support Listing that has been previously purchased or installed by users.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will GitHub maintain on any portion of Marketplace any Listing that you have removed from Marketplace and provided written notice to GitHub that such removal was due to</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) an allegation of infringement, or actual infringement, of any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person,</li>
  <li>(ii) an allegation of defamation or actual defamation,</li>
  <li>(iii) an allegation of violation, or actual violation, of any third party’s right of publicity or privacy, or</li>
  <li>(iv) an allegation or determination that such Listing does not comply with applicable law.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you remove a Listing from Marketplace pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1, and an End User purchased such Listing within a year before the date of takedown, GitHub is not responsible for refund(s) to the affected buyer of any amount paid by such End Customer during the year before the date of takedown for such affected Listing.</p>

<p><strong>4.2</strong>	GitHub Review and Takedowns. While GitHub is not obligated to monitor the Listing or their content, GitHub may at any time review or test your Listing for compliance with this Agreement, the Marketplace program policies, and any other applicable terms, obligations, laws, or regulations. GitHub retains the right to refuse to include a Listing on Marketplace in its sole discretion. You may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for Marketplace, or as part of your continued use of Marketplace. You agree that any information you give to Marketplace will always be accurate, correct and up to date. As part of the specification for your Listing, GitHub may ask that you include in the file for your Listing information such as your name and email address. GitHub may use this information when featuring the Listing in our directory or for other uses.</p>

<p>If GitHub is notified by you or otherwise becomes aware and determines in its sole discretion that a Listing or any portion thereof or your Brand Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>(a) violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third party;</li>
  <li>(b) violates any applicable law or is subject to an injunction;</li>
  <li>(c) is pornographic, obscene or otherwise violates GitHub’s hosting policies or other terms of service as may be updated by GitHub from time to time in its sole discretion;</li>
  <li>(d) is being distributed by you improperly;</li>
  <li>(e) may create liability for GitHub or any third party;</li>
  <li>(f) is deemed by GitHub to be malicious or defective;</li>
  <li>(g) violates the terms of this Agreement or the Marketplace program policies;</li>
  <li>(h) the display of the Listing is impacting the integrity of GitHub servers (i.e., users are unable to access such content or otherwise experience difficulty);</li>
  <li>(i) is deemed by GitHub to add undue risk to Marketplace End Users’ data or impair the user experience of Marketplace or GitHub;</li>
  <li>(j) is subject to user complaints in regards to your breach of your EULA, or</li>
  <li>(k) otherwise violates the Terms or this Agreement,</li>
</ul>

<p>GitHub may: prevent the Listing from being made available on Marketplace; remove the Listing from Marketplace; flag, filter, or modify related materials (including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata); or reclassify the Listing at its sole discretion. GitHub reserves the right to suspend or bar any Listing from Marketplace at its sole discretion.</p>

<p>In the event that your Listing is involuntarily removed because it is defective, malicious, infringes intellectual property rights of another person, defames, violates a third party’s right of publicity or privacy, or does not comply with applicable law, and an end user purchased such Listing within a year before the date of takedown:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(i) you must refund to the affected buyer all amounts paid by such End Customer during the year before the date of takedown for such affected Listing.</li>
  <li>(ii) GitHub may, at its sole discretion, withhold from your future sales the amount in subsection (i) above.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4.3</strong>	From time to time, GitHub may check for available updates to Listing, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. If you update your Listing to Marketplace, you agree that such update will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you.  GitHub makes no guarantees regarding the timing of such updates. For the avoidance of doubt, updates to Listing are subject to the same terms and conditions as the Listing, including without limitation Section 4.2 of this Agreement (GitHub Review and Takedowns).</p>

<p><strong>4.4</strong>	End-User Takedowns. If an End-User uses your Developer Product in a way that violates the Terms, then we have the right to suspend or terminate that End-User’s access to the Developer Product without any liability to you.</p>
