<h3 id="the-github-corporate-terms-of-service">The GitHub Corporate Terms of Service</h3>
<p>Effective date: May 22, 2017</p>

<h3 id="a-definitions">A. Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There’s not going to be a test on it, but it’s still useful information.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Corporate Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at <a href="https://github.com/site/privacy">github.com/site/privacy</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at <a href="/categories/site-policy/">help.github.com/categories/site-policy</a>.</li>
  <li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.</li>
  <li>The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as <a href="https://education.github.com/">education.github.com</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages.github.com</a>. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as <a href="https://CodeConf.com/">CodeConf.com</a> and product websites, such as <a href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a>. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.</li>
  <li>“Customer”, “You,” and “Your” refer to the company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See <a href="#6-additional-terms">Section B(6): Additional Terms</a>).</li>
  <li>“User” refers to the individual who has visited or is using the Website or Service on your behalf; that accesses or uses any part of the account on your behalf; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of their functions on your behalf. A User must be at least 13 years of age.</li>
  <li>“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
  <li>A “Corporate Account” refers to any account created by a User on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. A Corporate Account may include a Business plan, a Team plan, or a Developer plan.</li>
  <li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. “Content” also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Paid Content” is Content only available to Users who are participating in a payment plan, including private repositories.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="b-account-terms">B. Account Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your account; the creator and Users of your account must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-required-information">1. Required Information</h4>
<p>You must provide a valid email address and your company’s name in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you upgrade to a paid account. Please see the section on <a href="#k-payment">Payment</a> for information about paid accounts.</p>

<h4 id="2-corporate-terms-applicability">2. Corporate Terms Applicability</h4>
<p>The Corporate Terms of Service Agreement applies only if you are entering into an agreement with GitHub on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. If you are entering into an agreement with GitHub as an individual, you should not sign this Agreement; please use the <a href="/articles/github-terms-of-service">GitHub Terms of Service Agreement</a>. To the extent these terms conflict with any other terms you’ve accepted for use of GitHub.com, these terms will govern with respect to any work you do on GitHub on behalf of Customer.</p>

<p>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into the Agreement and bind the entity to these Terms.</p>

<h4 id="3-corporate-account-association">3. Corporate Account Association</h4>
<p>If you would like to associate your Corporate Account with a company name, we will do our best to confirm that association based on the information you provide to us. The more information you provide, the better able we will be to confirm that association. Information that helps us confirm a company’s association with an account includes: the name of the business included at the time of acceptance of these Terms, the payment information, and the email addresses associated with the account. In the event that you do not provide sufficient information for us to confirm your company’s association with the account, association will be determined by the email addresses and security settings within your account settings.</p>

<h4 id="4-corporate-account-requirements">4. Corporate Account Requirements</h4>
<p>You must create an individual account before you can create a Corporate Account. We have a few simple rules for individual accounts on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
    <ul>
      <li>A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine’s actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that’s fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>
  <li>You may not create an account for the use of any User under the age of 13. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will <a href="#l-cancellation-and-termination">terminate that User’s account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
  <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.</li>
  <li>Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you’ve ordered from us.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5-user-account-security">5. User Account Security</h4>
<p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure while using GitHub. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account’s security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under its account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</li>
  <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of its account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
  <li>You will promptly <a href="https://github.com/contact/">notify GitHub</a> if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6-additional-terms">6. Additional Terms</h4>
<p>In some situations, third parties’ terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties’ terms govern their relationships with you.</p>

<p>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this <a href="/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users/">Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service</a> applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>

<p>If you have signed up for a Business Plan, the <a href="/articles/github-business-plan-addendum/">Business Plan Addendum</a> applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>

<p>If you are an owner or administrator of an Organization on GitHub, additional terms may govern your relationship with us and supersede this Agreement.</p>

<h3 id="c-acceptable-use">C. Acceptable Use</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations">1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h4>
<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your and your Users’ use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>

<h4 id="2-content-restrictions">2. Content Restrictions</h4>
<p>You agree that under no circumstances will you or your Users upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;</li>
  <li>is or contains sexually obscene content;</li>
  <li>is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;</li>
  <li>is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;</li>
  <li>contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or</li>
  <li>infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-conduct-restrictions">3. Conduct Restrictions</h4>
<p>While using GitHub, you agree that under no circumstances, will you or your Users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users;</li>
  <li>use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;</li>
  <li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub’s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub’s servers through automated means, or to access GitHub’s Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the <a href="https://bounty.github.com/">GitHub Bug Bounty program</a>);</li>
  <li>impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site’s purpose; or</li>
  <li>violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person’s personal information without consent.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-services-usage-limits">4. Services Usage Limits</h4>
<p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub’s express written permission.</p>

<h4 id="5-scraping">5. Scraping</h4>
<p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub’s API. Please see <a href="#g-api-terms">Section G</a> for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.</li>
  <li>Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users’ personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>

<p>All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the <a href="https://github.com/site/privacy">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

<h4 id="6-privacy">6. Privacy</h4>
<p>Misuse of GitHub Users’ Personal Information is prohibited.</p>

<p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the <a href="https://github.com/site/privacy">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users’ Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User’s Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.</p>

<h4 id="7-excessive-bandwidth-use">7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</h4>
<p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>

<h4 id="8-user-protection">8. User Protection</h4>
<p>You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="d-user-generated-content">D. User-Generated Content</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content">1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h4>
<p>You may create User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you or your Users post, upload, link to or otherwise makes available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>

<h4 id="2-ownership-of-content-and-right-to-post">2. Ownership of Content and Right to Post</h4>
<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you and your Users create. If you’re posting anything you or your Users did not create yourselves and on your behalf, you agrees that you and your Users will only submit Content that you have the right to post, and you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you and your Users post.</p>

<h4 id="3-github-may-remove-content">3. GitHub May Remove Content</h4>
<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.</p>

<h4 id="4-license-grant-to-us">4. License Grant to Us</h4>
<p>Your Content belongs to you, and you are responsible for Content you post even if it does not belong to you. However, we need the legal right to do things like host it, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store and display your Content and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>

<p>That means you’re giving us the right to do things like reproduce your content (so we can do things like copy it to our database and make backups); display it (so we can do things like show it to you and other users); modify it (so our server can do things like parse it into a search index); distribute it (so we can do things like share it with other users); and perform it (in case your content is something like music or video).</p>

<p>This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell your Content or otherwise distribute it outside of our Service.</p>

<h4 id="5-license-grant-to-other-users">5. License Grant to Other Users</h4>
<p>Any Content you or your Users post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users’ repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and “fork” your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of your Content in repositories they control).</p>

<p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to access your Content through the GitHub Service, and to use, display and perform your Content, and to reproduce your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub’s functionality. You may grant further rights if you <a href="/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository">adopt a license</a>.</p>

<h4 id="6-contributions-under-repository-license">6. Contributions Under Repository License</h4>
<p>Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supercede.</p>

<p>Isn’t this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it’s commonly referred to by the shorthand “inbound=outbound”. We’re just making it explicit.</p>

<h4 id="7-moral-rights">7. Moral Rights</h4>
<p>You retain all moral rights to Content you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in this Section.</p>

<p>To the extent such an agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub a nonexclusive, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free right to (1) use the Content without attribution strictly as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service; and (2) make reasonable adaptations of the Content as provided in this Section. We need these rights to allow basic functions like search to work.</p>

<h4 id="8-private-repositories">8. Private Repositories</h4>
<p>Paid accounts may have <a href="/articles/making-a-public-repository-private/">private repositories</a>, which allow the User to control access to Content. GitHub employees <a href="/articles/github-security/#employee-access">only access private repositories when access is required for security or maintenance</a> or for support reasons, and then only with the consent of the repository owner. Because we respect your privacy in private repositories, you must respect the Terms of Service in everything you post to a private repository. If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to remove them.</p>

<h3 id="e-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy">E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h3>
<p>If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our <a href="/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/">Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy</a>. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via <a href="https://github.com/contact/dmca">our convenient DMCA form</a> or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.</p>

<p>We will terminate the accounts of <a href="/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/#e-repeated-infringement">repeat infringers</a> of this policy.</p>

<h3 id="f-intellectual-property-notice">F. Intellectual Property Notice</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-githubs-rights-to-content">1. GitHub’s Rights to Content</h4>
<p>GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.</p>

<h4 id="2-github-trademarks-and-logos">2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos</h4>
<p>If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.</p>

<h4 id="3-license-to-github-policies">3. License to GitHub Policies</h4>
<p>This Agreement is licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>. You may use it freely under the terms of the Creative Commons license.</p>

<h3 id="g-api-terms">G. API Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section G, when using any of GitHub’s APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.</em></p>

<h4 id="1-limitation-of-liability-for-api-use">1. Limitation of Liability for API Use</h4>
<p>You understand and agree that GitHub is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if GitHub has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</p>

<h4 id="2-no-abuse-or-overuse-of-the-api">2. No Abuse or Overuse of the API</h4>
<p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account’s access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p>

<p>You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub’s rate limitations.</p>
