**Please read our README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files before creating an issue. If you are creating an issue to provide feedback about our Closed Policies, please note that we may not incorporate your feedback into our policies due to laws that limit our flexibility around those issues. If your feedback is not related to any of the questions below, feel free to delete the template questions and enter your comments in free form.**

#### 1. What's the name of the policy?

#### 3. Did you already open a pull request? If so, please include a link to the PR in the [GitHub Docs repo](https://github.com/github/docs).

#### 4. Sometimes it's easier to just put your feedback text into an issue. If that's how you'd prefer to contribute, this is the section to do that.
