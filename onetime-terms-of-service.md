### The fly.io Terms of Service
Effective date: March 27, 2018


### A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the fly.io Privacy Statement, available at [fly.io/docs/privacy/](https://fly.io/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. 
2. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by fly.io.
3. The “Website” refers to fly.io’s website located at [fly.io](https://fly.io/), and all content, services, and products provided by fly.io at or through the Website. It also refers to fly.io-owned subdomains of fly.io, such as [play.fly.io](https://education.fly.io/). These Terms also govern fly.io’s product websites, such as [onehostname.com](https://onehostname.com/). Occasionally, websites owned by fly.io may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.
4. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.
5. “fly.io,” “We,” and “Us” refer to fly.io, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.

### B. Account Terms
**Short version:** *A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one trial account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.*

#### 1. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid account](#i-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

#### 2. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for accounts on fly.io's Service.
- You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:  
- A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.
- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
- You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. fly.io does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s account immediately](#j-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.
- Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.

#### 3. User Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.
- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. fly.io cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify fly.io](https://fly.io/contact) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

#### 4. Additional Terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of fly.io. For example, you may be a member of an organization on fly.io with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with fly.io; or you may use fly.io to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

### C. Acceptable Use
**Short version:** *fly.io hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

#### 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations
Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

#### 2. Content Restrictions
You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:

- is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
- is or contains sexually obscene content;
- is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
- is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
- contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
- infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.

#### 3. Conduct Restrictions
While using fly.io, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:
- harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including fly.io employees, officers, and agents, or other fly.io Users;
- use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
- attempt to disrupt or tamper with fly.io's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on fly.io's servers through automated means, or to access fly.io's Service in ways that exceed your authorization);
- impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with fly.io, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or
- violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.

#### 4. Services Usage Limits
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without fly.io's express written permission.

#### 5. Scraping
Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through fly.io's API. Please see [Section H](#h-api-terms) for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:
- Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from fly.io for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
- Archivists may scrape fly.io for public data for archival purposes.

You may not scrape fly.io for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling fly.io users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of fly.io data gathered through scraping must comply with the [fly.io Privacy Statement](https://fly.io/site/privacy/).

#### 6. Privacy
Misuse of fly.io Users' Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from fly.io must comply with the [fly.io Privacy Statement](https://fly.io/site/privacy/), particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the fly.io Privacy Statement). If you collect any fly.io User's Personal Information from fly.io, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from fly.io, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from fly.io or fly.io Users.

#### 7. Excessive Bandwidth Use on Free Services
_For free fly.io services:_ If we determine your bandwidth usage on to be significantly excessive in relation to other fly.io customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your service until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

#### 8. User Protection
You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.

### D. User-Generated Content
**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.*

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. fly.io May Remove Content
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any fly.io terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other fly.io Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting fly.io the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

#### 4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to serve application requests and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant fly.io the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5. License Grant to Other Users
By adding a collaborator to your Application, or to an Organization, you hereby grant to that user a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license, with no right to sub-license, to use, display, perform, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, list information regarding, edit, translate and analyze such Application(s) and Content as permitted by the relevant fly.io Services functionality or features for the sole purpose of collaborating on development of the Application(s).

#### 6. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant fly.io the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### E. Applications
**Short version:** *You may have access to applications. We treat the content of applications as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.*

#### 1. Control of Applications
Accounts may have applications, which allow the User to control access to Content.

#### 2. Confidentiality of Applications.
fly.io considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. fly.io will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

#### 3. Access.
fly.io employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:
- With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If fly.io accesses an application for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.
- When access is required for security reasons.

You may choose to enable additional access to your applications. For example:
- You may enable various fly.io services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in applications. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but fly.io will continue to treat your private application Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the fly.io Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.
- You may also grant a third-party application authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your applications. Your use of third-party applications is at your sole risk; fly.io is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access a private application.

#### 4. Exclusions.
If we have reason to believe the contents of an application are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/legal/privacy-policy/#how-we-respond-to-compelled-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your applications.

### F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/legal/dmca-takedown-policy/). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on fly.io violates your rights, please contact us by emailing support@fly.io. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the accounts of [repeat infringers](/legal/dmca-takedown-policy/#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

### G. Intellectual Property Notice
**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### H. API Terms
**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of fly.io's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses fly.io.*

#### No Abuse or Overuse of the API
Abuse or excessively frequent requests to fly.io via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. fly.io, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed fly.io's rate limitations.

All use of the fly.io API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [fly.io Privacy Statement](https://fly.io/legal/privacy-policy/).

fly.io may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of fly.io's Service.

### I. Payment

#### 1. Pricing
Our pricing and payment terms are available at [fly.io/pricing](https://fly.io/pricing/). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

#### 2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes

#### 3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds
- For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period.
- In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' applications.

### K. Communications with fly.io
**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

#### 1. Electronic Communication Required
For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

#### 2. Legal Notice to fly.io Must Be in Writing
Communications made through email or fly.io Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to fly.io or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to fly.io is required by contract or any law or regulation.

#### 3. No Phone Support
fly.io only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

### N. Release and Indemnification
**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release fly.io from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that fly.io (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases fly.io of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

### O. Changes to These Terms
**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.
