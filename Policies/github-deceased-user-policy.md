In the event that a GitHub user passes away, we can work with an authorized individual to determine what happens to the account's content. 

If you are next of kin, a [pre-designated successor](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/maintaining-ownership-continuity-of-your-user-accounts-repositories), or other authorized individual (which could include a collaborator or business partner) of a deceased user and would like to make a request regarding their account, you can reach out to us at https://support.github.com/contact. Please provide the following information in your message:

- Name
- Contact Information
- Name of the deceased account holder
- GitHub username of the deceased account holder
- Your relationship to the deceased account holder (please include whether you have been designated as the account successor on GitHub.com)
- If designated as account successor, the username of your GitHub account
- What action you are seeking (e.g. transfer public repositories, cancel billing on account)

Once we have received your request, we may follow up with a request for additional information, such as a copy of your photo identification, copy of the death certificate, and documentation confirming you are authorized to act in relation to the deceased userâ€™s account, to verify that we are properly authorized to process your request. 

Please note, the information you provide in your request is collected in accordance with our [Privacy Statement](/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement), and we will retain the information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations and resolve disputes.
