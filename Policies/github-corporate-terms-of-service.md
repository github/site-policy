### The GitHub Corporate Terms of Service
Effective date: May 25, 2018

### A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Corporate Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [help.github.com/categories/site-policy](/categories/site-policy/).
2. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub.
3. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [atom.io](https://atom.io/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.
4. "Customer", “You,” and “Your” refer to the company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See [Section B(7): Additional Terms](#7-additional-terms)).
5. "User" refers to the individual who has visited or is using the Website or Service on your behalf; that accesses or uses any part of the account on your behalf; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of their functions on your behalf. All Users must be at least 13 years of age. "Other Users" refers to the individuals, not including your Users, who visit or use the Website or Service. “Users” and “Other Users” are collectively referred to as “All Users”.
6. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
7. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. A "Corporate Account" refers to an Account created by a User on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. A Corporate Account may include a Business Cloud subscription or a Team plan. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
8. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by All Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create, own, or to which you are the rights holder.

### B. Account Terms
**Short version:** *User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; the creator and Users of your Account must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

#### 1. Account Controls. 
  * Users. All Users retain ultimate administrative control over their User Accounts and the Content within them. GitHub’s Standard Terms of Service govern All Users’ use of GitHub, except with respect to Users' activities under this Agreement.
  
  *	Organizations. You have ultimate administrative control over any Organization created on your behalf and User-Generated Content posted to the repositories within those Organizations, subject to these Terms. You can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. Within the Service, you must designate one or more User Accounts as “owners” who are delegated administrative control of the Organization, but this designation does not supersede your ultimate administrative rights over the Organization. This Agreement will govern the use of your Organization.
 
#### 2. Required Information
You must provide a valid email address and your company’s name in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you upgrade to a paid Account. Please see the section on [Payment](#l-payment) for information about paid Accounts.

#### 3. Corporate Terms Applicability
The Corporate Terms of Service Agreement applies only if you are entering into an agreement with GitHub on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. If you are entering into an agreement with GitHub as an individual, you should not sign this Agreement; please use the [GitHub Terms of Service Agreement](/articles/github-terms-of-service). To the extent these terms conflict with any other terms you've accepted for use of GitHub.com, these terms will govern with respect to any work you do on GitHub on behalf of Customer.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into the Agreement and bind the entity to these Terms.

#### 4. Corporate Account Association
If you would like to associate your Organization with a Corporate Account, we will do our best to confirm that association based on the information you provide to us. The more information you provide, the better able we will be to confirm that association. Information that helps us confirm a company's association with an Account includes: the name of the business included at the time of acceptance of these Terms, the payment information, and the email addresses associated with the Account. In the event that you do not provide sufficient information for us to confirm your company's association with the Account, association will be determined by the email addresses and security settings within your Account settings.

#### 5. Corporate Account Requirements
You must create a User Account before you can create a Corporate Account. We have a few simple rules for individual Accounts on GitHub:

- You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine Account:
  - A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine Account in addition to your free User Account.
- One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
- You may not create an Account for the use of any User under the age of 13. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#m-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization Account may only provide access to as many User Accounts as its subscription allows.
- Overall, the number of Users accessing Organizations associated with your Corporate Account must not exceed the number we have authorized for your Corporate Account.

#### 6. User Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while using GitHub. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.
- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of its Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify GitHub](https://github.com/contact/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

#### 7. Additional Terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users/) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Business Cloud, the [Business Cloud Addendum](/articles/github-business-cloud-addendum/) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

### C. Acceptable Use
**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

#### 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations
Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your and your Users' use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

#### 2. Content Restrictions
You agree that under no circumstances will you or your Users upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:

- is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
- is or contains sexually obscene content;
- is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
- is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;
- contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
- infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.

#### 3. Conduct Restrictions
While using GitHub, you agree that under no circumstances, will you or your Users:
- harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or Other Users;
- use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
- attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub's servers through automated means, or to access GitHub's Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/));
- impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or
- violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.

#### 4. Services Usage Limits
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission.

#### 5. Scraping
Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Please see [Section H](#h-api-terms) for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:
- Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
- Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.

You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Other Users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

#### 6. Privacy
Misuse of Other Users' Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy), particularly in regards to the collection of User Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any User Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which the Other User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitHub or Other Users.

#### 7. Excessive Bandwidth Use
If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to Other Users, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

#### 8. User Protection
You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms Other Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting All Users as a whole.

### D. User-Generated Content
**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you or your Users post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. GitHub May Remove Content
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you or your Users did not create yourselves and on your behalf, or do not own the rights to, you agree that you and your Users are responsible for any of that Content; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and Other Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless Other Users have forked it.

#### 4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you or those you choose to show it to; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with Other Users you choose to share it with; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video. We need these rights for both public and private repositories, because these rights are necessary for providing the Service.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you or your Users post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to Other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow Other Users to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that Other Users may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant Other Users of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to Other Users.

#### 6. Contributions Under Repository License
Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

#### 7. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you or your Users upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### E. Private Repositories
**Short version:** *You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.*

#### 1. Control of Private Repositories.
Some Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

#### 2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories.
GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

#### 3. Access.
GitHub employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:
- With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If GitHub accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.
- When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of GitHub's systems and Service.

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:
- You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

#### 4. Exclusions.
If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/articles/github-privacy-statement/#how-we-respond-to-compelled-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

### F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

### G. Intellectual Property Notice
**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

#### 1. GitHub's Rights to Content
GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

#### 2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos
If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.

#### 3. License to GitHub Policies
This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

### H. API Terms
**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

#### No Abuse or Overuse of the API
Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling  User Personal Information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API if you require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

### I. Additional Terms for GitHub Pages
**Short version:** *The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms.*

Each GitHub Account comes with access to the [GitHub Pages static hosting service](/articles/what-is-github-pages/). This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for All Users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses or other prohibited uses. Please see our [GitHub Pages guidelines](/articles/what-is-github-pages/) for more information.

GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.

### J. Third Party Applications
**Short version:** *You need to follow certain rules if you create an application for Other Users, and there are additional Terms that cover the Marketplace.*

#### 1. Creating Applications

If you create a third-party application or other developer product that collects User Personal Information or User-Generated Content and integrates with the Service through GitHub's API, OAuth mechanism, or otherwise ("Developer Product"), and make it available for Other Users, then you must comply with the following requirements:
- You must comply with this Agreement and the GitHub Privacy Statement.
- Except as otherwise permitted, such as by law or by a license, you must limit your usage of the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you collect to that purpose for which the User has authorized its collection. 
- You must take all reasonable security measures appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, presented by processing the User Personal Information or User-Generated Content.
- You must not hold yourself out as collecting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content on GitHub’s behalf, and provide sufficient notice of your privacy practices to the User, such as by posting a privacy policy.
- You must provide Users with a method of deleting any User Personal Information or User-Generated Content you have collected through GitHub after it is no longer needed for the limited and specified purposes for which the User authorized its collection, except where retention is required by law or otherwise permitted, such as through a license.

If you list a Developer Product through GitHub Marketplace, then you must agree to the [GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement](/articles/github-marketplace-developer-agreement/), prior to submitting the project to be listed. 

#### 2. Using Third-Party Applications

You may grant a Developer Product authorization to use, access, and disclose the contents of your repositories, including your private repositories. Some Developer Products are available through [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Some Developer Products can be used for performing automated tasks, and often times multiple Users may direct the actions of a Developer Product. However, if you purchase and/or set up a Developer Product on your Account, or you are an owner of an Account with an integrated Developer Product, then you will be responsible for the Developer Product's actions that are performed on or through your Account. Please see our [Privacy Statement](/articles/github-privacy-statement/#third-party-applications) for more information about how we share data with Developer Products. 

**GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Developer Products and is not liable for disclosures to third parties that you authorize to access Your Content. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.**

If you buy Developer Products through GitHub Marketplace, the [GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service](/articles/github-marketplace-terms-of-service/) controls your purchase. This Agreement, as well as the [GitHub Marketplace Terms of Service](/articles/github-marketplace-terms-of-service/), will govern your use of GitHub Marketplace. 

### K. Advertising on GitHub
**Short version:** *We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.*

#### 1. GitHub Pages
We offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.

#### 2. GitHub Repositories
GitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub.

You may not advertise in Other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.

#### 3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub
Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.

### L. Payment
**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

#### 1. Pricing
Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing) (unless otherwise negotiated by both parties and stated in an order form). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

#### 2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes
- We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
- If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
- If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
- You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#m-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

#### 3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds
- For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months or partial years of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months or years unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period.
- In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

#### 4. Authorization
By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.

Subject to the limitations above, you agree to indemnify us and us hold harmless from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, **provided that GitHub (a) promptly gives Customer written Notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding.; (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit, or proceeding (provided that Customer may not settle any claim, demand, suit, or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (c) provides to Customer all reasonable assistance, at Customer’s expense.**

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes, provided that GitHub (i) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (ii) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (iii) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

#### 2. GitHub’s Indemnification
We’ll defend or settle, at our option and expense, any third-party claim brought against you to the extent that it’s based on an allegation that GitHub’s service infringes a copyright or misappropriates a trade secret of any third party (each, a “Claim”), and, subject to Section O, above, Limitation of Liability, we’ll pay all damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of final appeal attributable to such a Claim, provided that you notify us in writing of any such Claim as soon as reasonably practicable and allow us to control, and reasonably cooperate with us in the defense of, any such Claim and related settlement negotiations.

You understand that we’ll have no obligation to indemnify you for any claim (1) if the total aggregate fees received by GitHub with respect to your subscription to the services in the 12 month period immediately preceding the claim is less than US $50,000; (2) if the services are modified by any party other than GitHub, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the services are used in combination with any services, software, or equipment without prior written authorization by GitHub, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorized use of the services; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) your Content (or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in this Section Q (Release and Indemnification: Customer’s Indemnification)) or (z) any third-party deliverables or components contained with the services; or (6) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a claim without GitHub’s prior written consent.

If your use of the services is, or in our reasonable opinion is likely to be, subject to a Claim under this Section Q, we may, at our sole option and at no charge to you (and in addition to our indemnity obligation to you in this Section Q): (i) procure for you the right to continue using the services; (ii) replace or modify the services so that they are non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the original services; or (iii) if options (i) and (ii) above are not commercially practicable in our reasonable estimation, we can terminate these Terms of Service.
