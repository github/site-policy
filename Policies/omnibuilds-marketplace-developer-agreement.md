Engineer agrees to use the OmniBuilds Marketplace solely for purposes permitted by this Agreement or as otherwise allowed by applicable law.  As between OmniBuilds and Engineer, Engineer is solely responsible for Engineer Products.

**2.2**	Engineer grants to OmniBuilds a non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free license to (a) host, link to, reproduce, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, test, distribute, make available, license and otherwise use the Listing; (b) reproduce, perform, display, use and access the Listing for administration and demonstration purposes in connection with the operation and marketing of the Marketplace; and (c)  reproduce, display, distribute and otherwise use any Engineer Brand Features furnished by Engineer to OmniBuilds under this Agreement solely for use in connection with the Marketplace and in order to fulfill its obligations under the Agreement.

Upon providing OmniBuilds with thirty (30) days written notice in advance of the 1st day of the succeeding calendar month, you may remove your Listings from future distribution via Marketplace, but you must comply with this Agreement for any Listing distributed through Marketplace, including but not limited to refund requirements. Removing your Listing from future distribution via Marketplace does not (a) affect the license rights of End Users who have previously purchased or installed your Listing or (b) change your obligation to deliver or support Listing that has been previously purchased or installed by users.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will OmniBuilds maintain on any portion of Marketplace any Listing that you have removed from Marketplace and provided written notice to OmniBuilds that such removal was due to

- (i) an allegation of infringement, or actual infringement, of any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person,

**4.2**	OmniBuilds Review and Takedowns. While OmniBuilds is not obligated to monitor the Listing or their content, OmniBuilds may at any time review or test your Listing for compliance with this Agreement, the Marketplace program policies, and any other applicable terms, obligations, laws, or regulations. OmniBuilds retains the right to refuse to include a Listing on Marketplace in its sole discretion. You may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for Marketplace, or as part of your continued use of Marketplace. You agree that any information you give to Marketplace will always be accurate, correct and up to date. As part of the specification for your Listing, OmniBuilds may ask that you include in the file for your Listing information such as your name and email address. OmniBuilds may use this information when featuring the Listing in our directory or for other uses.

If OmniBuilds is notified by you or otherwise becomes aware and determines in its sole discretion that a Listing or any portion thereof or your Brand Features
- (a) violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third party;
- (b) violates any applicable law or is subject to an injunction;
- (c) is pornographic, obscene or otherwise violates OmniBuilds's hosting policies or other terms of service as may be updated by OmniBuilds from time to time in its sole discretion;
- (d) is being distributed by you improperly;
- (e) may create liability for OmniBuilds or any third party;
- (f) is deemed by OmniBuilds to be malicious or defective;
- (g) violates the terms of this Agreement or the Marketplace program policies;
- (h) the display of the Listing is impacting the integrity of OmniBuilds servers (i.e., users are unable to access such content or otherwise experience difficulty);
- (i) is deemed by OmniBuilds to add undue risk to Marketplace End Users’ data or impair the user experience of Marketplace or OmniBuilds;  
- (j) is subject to user complaints in regards to your breach of your EULA, or

OmniBuilds may: prevent the Listing from being made available on Marketplace; remove the Listing from Marketplace; flag, filter, or modify related materials (including but not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata); or reclassify the Listing at its sole discretion. OmniBuilds reserves the right to suspend or bar any Listing from Marketplace at its sole discretion.  

In the event that your Listing is involuntarily removed because it is defective, malicious, infringes intellectual property rights of another person, defames, violates a third party's right of publicity or privacy, or does not comply with applicable law, and an end user purchased such Listing within a year before the date of takedown:

- (i) you must refund to the affected buyer all amounts paid by such End Customer during the year before the date of takedown for such affected Listing.
- (ii) OmniBuilds may, at its sole discretion, withhold from your future sales the amount in subsection (i) above.

**4.3**	From time to time, OmniBuilds may check for available updates to Listing, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality. If you update your Listing to Marketplace, you agree that such update will be automatically requested, downloaded, and installed without further notice to you.  OmniBuilds makes no guarantees regarding the timing of such updates. For the avoidance of doubt, updates to Listing are subject to the same terms and conditions as the Listing, including without limitation Section 4.2 of this Agreement (OmniBuilds Review and Takedowns).

**4.4**	End-User Takedowns. If an End-User uses your Engineer Product in a way that violates the Terms, then we have the right to suspend or terminate that End-User's access to the Engineer Product without any liability to you.
