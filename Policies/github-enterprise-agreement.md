### SECTION A: GITHUB ENTERPRISE - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Section A sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to your use of any of the Products.

#### 1. Definitions

"Affiliate" means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a Party where "control" means having more than fifty percent (50%) voting power of the controlled entity.

"Effective Date" is the earlier of the date on which you (i) agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as described above, or (ii) first place an Order for the Products.

"Fees" means the fees you are required to pay GitHub to (i) use the Products during the applicable Subscription Term or (ii) receive Professional Services, as such fees are reflected on an Order Form or SOW.

"GitHub Partner" means a company authorized to resell Products under GitHub's Channel Partner Agreement.

"Order Form" means written or electronic documentation (including a quote) that the Parties use to order the Products. The Order Form will specify the authorized scope of use for the Products, which may include: (i) license type, (ii) number of Subscription Licenses, (iii)  Subscription Term, or (iv) other restrictions or special terms (collectively, the "Scope of Use"). Upon execution by the Parties (or, in the case of electronic orders, confirmation and placement of the order), each Order Form will be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

"Parties" means, collectively, GitHub and you. Each may be referred to individually as a "Party."

"Professional Services" means training, consulting, or implementation services that GitHub provides to you pursuant to a mutually executed SOW. Services do not include Support.

"Professional Services Credits" means the upfront payment method for purchasing Professional Services (exclusive of travel and lodging expenses) that you may use over a period of twelve (12) months (unless otherwise stated in an Order Form) for Professional Services. Any Professional Services Credits that remain unused at the end of twelve (12) months from the date of purchase (or as otherwise stated in an Order Form) are automatically cancelled and are non-refundable.

“Subscription License” means the license assigned to each User to install, operate, access, and use the Product or Service on your behalf. You may only assign one Subscription License per User across your GitHub Enterprise Server instances and GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organizations. Each User will have access to as many of your Enterprise Server instances or  Enterprise Cloud Organizations, as you permit. For clarity, however, once you assign a Subscription License to a User, you will not be authorized to bifurcate the Subscription License so that one User can use a Subscription License on Enterprise Server while another User uses the same Subscription License on another instance of Enerprise Server or on an Organization on Enterprise Cloud.

"SOW" means a mutually executed statement of work detailing the Professional Services GitHub will perform for you, any related Fees, and each Party's related obligations.

"Subscription Term" means one (1) year from the applicable effective date of an Order or as stated in the Order Form.

#### 2. Payment

**2.1 Fees.** You agree to pay the Fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars (or Professional Services Credits, if applicable), unless otherwise specified in an Order Form or unless purchasing through an authorized third party (in which case, payment terms will be agreed upon between you and the authorized third party). You must pay the Fees within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice that GitHub sends to you related to the applicable Order Form or SOW. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as provided in Sections A.3.2, A.4.1 and B.12.1. If you fail to pay any Fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW. You are solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

**2.2 Professional Services Credits.** If you use Professional Services Credits as the means of payment for Professional Services, then upon your receipt of an SOW, the applicable Professional Services Credits will be deducted from your Professional Services Credits balance. You are responsible for ensuring that your purchase order ("PO") issued to GitHub for the Professional Services reflects the pricing set forth in the SOW. If there is any difference in pricing listed in the SOW and the pricing listed in the PO, the pricing in the SOW will control. The Parties agree that SOWs payable via Professional Services Credits do not have to be signed by either Party to be valid and enforceable. Subject to the SOW, all Fees paid by you are non-refundable and all Professional Services Credits must be used within the time set forth in the Order Form or will automatically be cancelled and are non-refundable. You may not apply Professional Services Credits to travel and lodging expenses, which must be invoiced separately.

#### 3.  Professional Services

**3.1 Professional Services.** Upon your request for Professional Services, GitHub will provide a statement of work detailing such Professional Services. Each SOW is binding upon execution by the Parties and any Professional Services will be governed by the terms of the applicable SOW and this Agreement.

To the extent GitHub delivers anything to you during the course of performing the Professional Services, GitHub grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free, limited-term license to use those deliverables during the term of this Agreement, solely in conjunction with your use of the Software.

**3.2 Limited Warranty.** Unless otherwise set forth in an SOW, GitHub warrants that any Professional Services performed under this Agreement will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner by appropriately qualified personnel. GitHub's only obligation, and your only remedy, for a breach of this warranty will be, at GitHub's option and expense, to either: (i) promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to meet this warranty or (ii) if the breach cannot be cured, terminate the SOW and refund the unused prepaid Fees.

#### 4.  Defense of Claims; Release

The Parties will defend each other against the third-party claims described in this Section 4 and will pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or approved settlement, but only if the defending party is promptly notified in writing of the claim and has the right to control the defense and any settlement of it.

(ii) Limitation of Total Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND EXCLUDING THE PARTIES’ RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 4, EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES CUSTOMER HAS ACTUALLY PAID TO GITHUB DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (INCLUDING USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICE) THAT ARE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE, GITHUB’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO $5,000.00 USD.


#### 6. Confidentiality

**6.1 Definition of Confidential Information.** For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all non-public information disclosed by either Party to the others, whether in writing, orally or by other means, designated as confidential or that the receiving Party knows or reasonably should know, under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure and the nature of the information, is confidential to the disclosing Party. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the source code of the Software will be deemed to be GitHub's Confidential Information, regardless of whether it is marked as such. For the avoidance of doubt, no content posted on the Website or Service will be considered Confidential Information unless such content is stored solely in your private repositories on the Service.

**6.2 Exclusions.** Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) was or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was rightfully known or becomes rightfully known to the receiving party without confidential or proprietary restriction from a source other than the disclosing party who has a right to disclose it; (iii) is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing party; (iv) the receiving party independently develops without access to or use of the other Party's Confidential Information; or (v) subject to Section C.5, is or has been stored or posted on the Website or Service and outside of your private repositories.

**6.3 Restrictions on Use and Disclosure.** Neither Party will use the other Party's Confidential Information, except as permitted under this Agreement. Each Party agrees to maintain in confidence and protect the other Party's Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care as it uses for its own information of a similar nature, but in any event at least a reasonable degree of care. Each Party agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of the other Party's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, disclosing such Confidential Information only to its employees, independent contractors, consultants, and legal and financial advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who (i) have a need to know such information, (ii) are parties to appropriate agreements sufficient to comply with this Section A.6, and (iii) are informed of the restrictions on use and disclosure set forth in this Section A.6. Each Party is responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives. The foregoing obligations will not restrict either Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other Party pursuant to the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body, *provided* that the Party required to make such a disclosure gives reasonable notice to the other Party to enable such Party to contest such order or requirement. The restrictions set forth in this Section A.6 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

#### 7. Term and Termination

**7.1 Term.** This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and will continue in effect until terminated by a Party in accordance with this Section A.7, subject to Section A.7.4.

**7.2 Termination for Convenience.** Either Party may terminate an Order Form or this Agreement, with or without cause, upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice.

**7.3 Termination for Material Breach.** Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if the other Party breaches a material obligation under this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days from the date it receives notification. Either Party reserves the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice, but without giving the other Party a cure period, as follows: if you breach any of the terms of this Agreement relating to GitHub's intellectual property (including your non-compliance with the license grant or any license restrictions) or either Party breaches its confidentiality obligations.

**7.4 Effect of Termination; Survival.** Upon termination of this Agreement, you may not execute additional Order Forms; however, this Agreement will remain in effect for the remainder of any active Order Forms. When an Order Form terminates or expires, as to that Order Form: (i) the Subscription Term for the Software and/or Service will immediately end; (ii) you will no longer have the right to use the Software or the Service, and any Subscription Licenses or access granted in the Order Form will automatically cease to exist as of the date of termination or expiration; (iii) if any Fees were owed prior to termination, you must pay those Fees immediately; (iv) you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control, and certify in writing to GitHub that you have done so; and (v) each Party will promptly return to the other (or, if the other party requests it, destroy) all Confidential Information belonging to the other to the extent permitted by the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may continue to access the Software to migrate your data and may request migration of the data in your repositories for up to ninety (90) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form; however, you may not use the Software on a production basis during that time. Any provisions which by their nature should reasonably survive will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form.

**10.6. Supported Releases.** GitHub will only Support a given Release of the Software for one (1) year from the original Release date, or six (6) months from the last Update of the Release, whichever is longer.

(i) Users. All Users retain ultimate administrative control over their User Accounts and the Content within them. GitHub's Standard Terms of Service govern All Users' use of the Website, except with respect to Users' activities under this Section C.

(ii) Organizations. You have ultimate administrative control over any Organization created on your behalf and User-Generated Content posted to the repositories within those Organizations, subject to this Section C.

(iii) Corporate Account Requirements. You must create a User Account before creating a Corporate Account, or you must allow GitHub to create a Corporate Account and/or Organization on your behalf. In order to create a User Accounts, the following are required:

-   You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine Accounts. A machine Account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the applicable terms of service on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine Account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine Account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine Account in addition to your free User Account.

-   One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).

-   You may not create an Account for use of any User under the age of 13. GitHub does not target the Service to children under 13, and it does not permit any Users under 13 on the Service. If GitHub learns of any User under the age of 13, it will terminate that User's Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country's minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country's laws.

-   Your login may only be used by one person (i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people). A paid organization Account may only provide access to as many User Accounts as its subscription allows.

-   Overall, the number of Users accessing Organizations associated with your Corporate Account must not exceed the number of Subscription Licenses GitHub has authorized for such Corporate Account. You may reassign a Subscription License, subject to the definition of Subscription Licenses in Section A above, to a new User, but not less than 90 days since the last reassignment of that same Subscription License, unless the reassignment is due to (i) permanent hardware failure or loss, (ii) termination of the User’s employment or contract, or (iii) temporary reallocation of Subscription Licenses to cover a User’s absence. Reassignment of a Subscription License for any other purpose must be permanent. When you reassign a Subscription License from one User to another, you must block access to the Subscription License and your Organizations by the former User’s User Account.

-   You are not a person who is barred from using GitHub under United States law or the laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not be located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-and-export-controls).

For example, you may be a member of an organization with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with the Service; or you may use the Service to authenticate to another service. While this Agreement is GitHub's full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you. If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any portion of the Service in a government capacity, the [Government Amendment](/articles/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-u-s-federal-government-users) applies, and you agree to its provisions.

**12.2 Service Level Agreement (SLA).**

(i) Program Benefits – Uptime Guarantee and Calculation. GitHub guarantees that the Service will have a quarterly Uptime percentage of 99.95%. That means GitHub's Essential Services will not be interrupted by an Outage affecting more than 50% of Active Users, for more than .05% of the quarter. If GitHub doesn't meet such 99.95% quarterly Uptime guarantee, GitHub may issue Service Credits to customers. GitHub's Uptime calculation is based on the percentage of successful requests it serves through its web, API, and Git client interfaces.

(ii) Exclusions. Exclusions from the Uptime guarantee include Outages resulting from:

-   Scheduled Downtime;

-   Your acts, omissions, or misuse of the Services, including violations of this Agreement;

-   Failures of your internet connectivity;

-   Factors outside GitHub's reasonable control, including Internet access related problems, force majeure events, and third-party services or technology; or

-   Your equipment, services, or other technology.

(iii) Calculation of Uptime Service Credits; Redemption of Uptime Service Credits.

If GitHub's quarterly Uptime percentage drops below its 99.95% Uptime guarantee, then you are entitled to receive a Service Credit equal to 25 times the amount that was paid for the Outage time that exceeds the quarterly Uptime guarantee. Service Credits are calculated at the end of each quarter, and may only be granted upon request.

To find out about GitHub's Uptime percentage, you can request an Uptime report at the end of each quarter.

In order to be granted Service Credits, either an Account Owner or Billing Manager must send a written request, on your behalf, within thirty (30) days of the end of each quarter. Service Credits may not be saved. After being granted a Service Credit, it will be automatically applied to your next bill. Written requests should be sent to [GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact).

**12.3 Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability.** GitHub's [Status Page](https://status.github.com/) is not connected to the Uptime guarantee set forth in this Section and is not an accurate representation of GitHub's Uptime for the purposes of calculating Service Credits. Service Credits are limited to thirty (30) days of paid service, per quarter. Service Credits are your only remedy for any failure by GitHub to meet any Uptime obligations as identified in this Section.

GitHub will, upon Customer's written request, provide Customer with this list of subprocessors and the terms under which they process the Customer Personal Data. Pursuant to subprocessor confidentiality restrictions, GitHub may remove any confidential or commercially sensitive information before providing the list and the terms to Customer. In the event that GitHub cannot disclose confidential or sensitive information to Customer, the Parties agree that GitHub will provide all information it reasonably can in connection with its subprocessing agreements.

**6.5 Objection to Subprocessors.** GitHub will provide thirty days' prior written notice of the addition or removal of any subprocessor, including the categories listed in Section 6.4, by announcing changes on its <https://github.com/github/site-policy> site. If Customer has a reasonable objection to GitHub's engagement of a new subprocessor, Customer must notify GitHub promptly in writing. Where possible, GitHub will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide an alternative solution to the affected Service to avoid processing of data by the objectionable subprocessor. In the event that GitHub is unable to provide an alternative solution and the Parties cannot resolve the conflict within ninety days, Customer may terminate the Agreement.

#### 7. Termination

**7.1 Suspension.** In the event that GitHub is in breach of its obligations to maintain an adequate level of security or privacy protection, Customer may temporarily suspend the transfer of all Customer Personal Data or prohibit collection and processing of Customer Personal Data on Customer's behalf until the breach is repaired or the Agreement is terminated.
