**Short version:** _We host a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the Service, you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policies, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations.

For customers subject to the [Corporate Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-corporate-terms-of-service), "you" and "your" refer to "Customer" or "Users".

### 4. Services Usage Limits
You will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without our express written permission.

### 5. Scraping and API Usage Restrictions
Scraping refers to extracting data from our Service via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through our API. Please see Section H of our [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service#h-api-terms) and [Corporate Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-corporate-terms-of-service#h-api-terms) for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:

- Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from the Service for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
- Archivists may scrape the Service for public data for archival purposes.

You may not scrape the Service for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling User Personal Information (as defined in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement)), such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of data gathered through scraping must comply with the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement).

### 6. Privacy
Misuse of User Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from the Service must comply with the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement), particularly in regards to the collection of User Personal Information. If you collect any User Personal Information from the Service, you agree that you will only use that User Personal Information for the purpose for which that User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from the Service, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from us or other users.

### 7. Excessive Bandwidth Use
The Service's bandwidth limitations vary based on the features you use. If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other users of similar features, we reserve the right to suspend your Account, throttle your file hosting, or otherwise limit your activity until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption. See the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/github/site-policy/github-additional-product-terms) for more details on specific features' bandwidth limitations.

### 8. Advertising on GitHub
**Short version:** *We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.*

While we understand that you may want to promote your Content by posting supporters' names or logos in your Account, the primary focus of the Content posted in or through your Account to the Service should not be advertising or promotional marketing. This includes Content posted in or through Pages, Packages, repositories, and all other parts of the Service. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents or project description sections associated with your Account, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub. You may not advertise in other Users' Accounts, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.

You may not promote or distribute content or activity that is illegal or otherwise prohibited by our [Terms of Service](/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service/), [Community Guidelines](/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines/), or [Acceptable Use Policy](/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies/), including excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), get-rich-quick schemes, and misrepresentation or deception related to your promotion.

If you decide to post any promotional materials in your Account, you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Guidelines on Endorsements and Testimonials. We reserve the right to remove any promotional materials or advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.

### 9. Spam and Inauthentic Activity on GitHub
Automated excessive bulk activity and coordinated inauthentic activity, such as spamming, are prohibited on GitHub. Prohibited activities include:
* bulk distribution of promotions and advertising prohibited by GitHub terms and policies
* inauthentic interactions, such as fake accounts and automated inauthentic activity
* rank abuse, such as automated starring or following
* creation of or participation in secondary markets for the purpose of the proliferation of inauthentic activity
* using GitHub as a platform for propagating abuse on other platforms
* phishing or attempted phishing

GitHub reserves the right to remove any Content in violation of this policy.

### 10. User Protection
You must not engage in activity that significantly harms other users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole.
