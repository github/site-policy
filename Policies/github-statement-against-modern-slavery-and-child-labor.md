*2018 statement*
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), [40 million people were victims of modern slavery and 152 million children were subject to child labor](https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_574717/lang--en/index.htm) globally in 2016. As the [ILO reports](https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm):
   - 1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children.
   - Out of the 24.9 million people trapped in forced labour, 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labour imposed by state authorities.
   -	Women and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labour, accounting for 99% of victims in the commercial sex industry, and 58% in other sectors.

 GitHub deplores the presence and persistence of modern slavery and child labor, and takes seriously its responsibility to ensure that neither modern slavery nor child labor takes place in its supply chain or in any part of its business. ("Modern slavery" in this statement refers to slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, and workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded. "Child labor" refers to work performed by someone under 16 years of age, or under 14 for light work, provided it is not confined to periods that interfere with the child's schooling and not in conditions that interfere with the child's health or well-being.)

 In accordance with the [UK Modern Slavery Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/30/section/54/enacted), and in alignment with the [ILO 2014 Protocol to its Forced Labour Convention](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:P029), [ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work](https://www.ilo.org/declaration/thedeclaration/textdeclaration/lang--en/index.htm), and [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target 8.7](https://www.unodc.org/roseap/en/sustainable-development-goals.html#:~:text=Target%208.7%20%2D%20Take%20immediate%20and,labour%20in%20all%20its%20forms), this 2018 Statement Against Modern Slavery and Child Labor ("the Statement") describes the steps GitHub has taken to prevent modern slavery and child labor from occurring in its business or supply chain.

 ## GitHub's structure, business, and supply chains

GitHub is a software development platform with its headquarters in San Francisco, and employees and contractors working in numerous countries.
All GitHub employees and individual independent contractors are voluntary and at-will. GitHub has a largely distributed workforce, and strives to provide competitive compensation and benefits to its employees and contractors regardless of location. This is true whether we hire independent contractors directly or through an intermediary.
GitHub does not conduct manufacturing or produce hardware, nor does GitHub use recruitment agencies for the kinds of services often performed by migrant workers. The nature of GitHub's business does not subject it to sudden changes in workload or pricing pressures, which often drive demand for practices that increase the risk of forced labor in supply chains, such as forced overtime.
GitHub offers free and paid software and web-based software as a service to customers all over the world. GitHub's products include:
   - GitHub.com: web-based collaboration and code-hosting platform
   - GitHub Enterprise: on-premises collaboration and code hosting software
   - Atom: text editor
   - Electron: framework for writing cross-platform desktop apps
   - GitHub Desktop: desktop app for accessing GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise
GitHub's supply chain consists of goods and services for our products and operations including computing services, event planning, purchase of retail and promotional items, office supplies, and leasing of facilities such as office space and data centers.
## Policies in relation to modern slavery and child labor
### Modern slavery and child labor
**GitHub's Code of Ethics** prohibits knowingly using, participating in, supporting, or tolerating modern slavery (slavery, forced or compulsory labor, trafficking, servitude, or workers who are imprisoned, indentured, or bonded) or child labor in its business operations. Any GitHub employee or contractor who violates this prohibition will be subject to termination of employment or business relationship.
