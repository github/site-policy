GitHub provides a great deal of transparency regarding how we use your data, how we collect your data, and with whom we share your data. To that end, we provide this page, which details [our subprocessors](#github-subprocessors), and how we use [cookies](#cookies-on-github).

## GitHub Subprocessors

When we share your information with third party subprocessors, such as our vendors and service providers, we remain responsible for it. We work very hard to maintain your trust when we bring on new vendors, and we require all vendors to enter into data protection agreements with us that restrict their processing of Users' Personal Information (as defined in the [Privacy Statement](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)).

When we bring on a new subprocessor who handles our Users' Personal Information, or remove a subprocessor, or we change how we use a subprocessor, we will update the list of subprocessors. You can view the current list of subprocessors, and sign up to receive subprocessor list updates, at [https://github.com/privacy/subprocessors](https://github.com/privacy/subprocessors).

If you have questions or concerns about a new subprocessor, we'd be happy to help. Please contact us via {% data variables.contact.contact_privacy %}.

## Cookies on GitHub

GitHub uses cookies to provide and secure our websites, as well as to analyze the usage of our websites, in order to offer you a great user experience. Please take a look at our [Privacy Statement](/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking) if youâ€™d like more information about cookies, and on how and why we use them.

You can view the current list of cookies on GitHub, and sign up to receive cookie list updates, at [https://github.com/privacy/cookies](https://github.com/privacy/cookies).
