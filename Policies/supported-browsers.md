{{#intro}}

{{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} is designed to support the latest web browsers. We support the current versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), [Microsoft Edge](http://www.browserfordoing.com/) and [Internet Explorer 11](http://ie.microsoft.com/).

### Firefox Extended Support Release

We do our best to support Firefox's latest [Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/) (ESR). Some features on {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} may be disabled in older versions and require the latest version of Firefox.

### Internet Explorer on Windows XP

Because Windows XP is not supported, you'll receive an error when you try to load {{ site.data.variables.product.product_name }} in Internet Explorer. For more information, see "[Improving GitHub's SSL setup](https://github.com/blog/1937-improving-github-s-ssl-setup)" on the GitHub Blog.

### Internet Explorer Outdated Browser Error

We only support IE running in "Standards Mode." If you see an error message saying your browser is outdated, turn off "Compatibility View".

### Beta and developer builds

You may occasionally encounter unexpected bugs in beta and developer builds of our supported browsers. If you encounter a bug on GitHub.com in one of these unreleased builds, please verify that it also exists in the stable version of the same browser. If the bug appears to only exist in the unstable version, you might consider reporting it to the browser developer.
