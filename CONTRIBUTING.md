# Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to our Site Policies. Your help is essential. Our [README](README.md) describes the project, its purpose, and caveats, and is necessary reading for contributors.

Contributions to this project are dedicated to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](LICENSE.md).

Remember that information in this repo [is not legal advice and comes without warranty](README.md#disclaimer).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

As we mentioned in the README, we're mostly looking for contributions to a few of our policies, which are listed below. However, just because a policy is on the list, it does not mean that the terms are flexible. The current Terms of Service can found on our website, at https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service, and all Users must agree to them before using our website. We've opened this repo to provide more transparency around the updates to those Terms of Service, to allow you all to help us improve them, and to do so the GitHub way. Here are the policies we're currently hoping you'll contribute to:

* [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service)
* [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies)
* [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)
* [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)
* [GitHub Global Privacy Practices](https://docs.github.com/github/site-policy/global-privacy-practices)


The two main ways to contribute are through issues and pull requests. We've [open sourced GitHub Docs](https://github.blog/2020-10-07-github-docs-are-now-open-source/) and now seek pull request in the [GitHub Docs repo](https://github.com/github/docs). To track site-policy changes, we ask you to open issues in this repo, and we've made a [template](https://github.com/github/site-policy/issues/new) to request information that will help us better understand your feedback.
## Help Wanted

Before you decide to open an issue, browse [open issues](https://github.com/github/site-policy/issues) to see current requests. We also generally want to hear about:

* International issues with our policies
* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of our policies

[Open an issue](https://github.com/github/site-policy/issues/new) to tell us about any of the above. You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

**NOTE:** Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps us know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If you decide to open a pull request, please do so directly in the [GitHub Docs repo](https://github.com/github/docs) and link to it in your issue in this repo to help us track site-policy-specific changes. Please be aware that it is unlikely that we will merge your pull request directly unless it is a typo correction. It's not because we don't like your ideas, but because we may need to iterate on them internally, and officially open a pull request with our take with the amount of notice appropriate for the policy in question.

In general, before we make official changes to our site policies, we will open a pull request in this repository, showing all the draft changes on a working branch. In that pull request, we will do our best to cross link back to open issues or pull requests that we think are resolved or addressed by the draft changes. When those draft changes are ready to be published, we will make them on the official live version at https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy. After that, we'll merge the working branch in this repository.

**NOTE:** Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. We may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If you need help, [contact Support](https://github.com/contact) and they'll get you an answer.
