We want to keep GitHub safe for everyone. If you've discovered a security vulnerability in GitHub, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Bounty Program

Like several other large software companies, GitHub provides a "bug bounty" to better engage with security researchers. The idea is simple: hackers and security researchers (like you) find and report vulnerabilities through our responsible disclosure process. Then, to recognize the significant effort that these researchers often put forth when hunting down bugs, we reward them with some cold hard cash.

Check out the [GitHub Bug Bounty](https://bounty.github.com) site for full details, and happy hunting!
